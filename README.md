# Skunk-Game
This is a dice game. It is the second game I have made using JavaScript
It is called skunk similar to the commercial version
I will look to make more dice games such as this in the future
This helps us understand probability

The rules of the game are simple

First player to 100 wins the game.
If you roll a 1, you're score gets reset and it is the next player's turn immediately
